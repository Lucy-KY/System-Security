# System Security — Seed Labs

This repository contains a set of seed labs focused on low-level system security concepts. The labs are designed to help you learn how processors handle function calls and parameters, how memory is organized (stack vs heap), and how pointers/jumps transfer control and data between components.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand processor calling conventions and how arguments are passed.
- Explore stack layout, stack frames, and how local variables are stored.
- Inspect heap allocation and observe dynamic memory behavior.
- Follow pointers and control-flow transfers between functions and modules.
- Experiment with basic memory-safety issues (e.g., buffer handling) in a controlled lab environment.

## Lab Topics (examples)

- Function call mechanics and parameter passing (registers vs stack).
- Stack frames, return addresses, and frame pointers.
- Heap allocation patterns and leaks.
- Pointer arithmetic, dereferencing, and aliasing.
- Control transfer via function pointers and indirect jumps.
- Intro to exploitation concepts (only for learning and defense): buffer overflows, format strings.

## Prerequisites

- A Linux environment (the devcontainer provides Ubuntu 24.04 in this workspace).
- Basic C programming knowledge and familiarity with the command line.
- Recommended tools: `gcc`, `clang`, `gdb`, `valgrind`, `objdump` / `readelf`.

## Getting Started

1. Open this workspace in the provided dev container or any Linux environment.
2. Build the lab programs (each lab usually contains a `Makefile` or simple compile command):

```bash
make all
# or compile individual exercises, e.g.
gcc -g -O0 lab1.c -o lab1
```

3. Run and inspect the programs under `gdb` to observe stack/heap and registers:

```bash
gdb ./lab1
# inside gdb: run, break main, next, info registers, x/16x $sp
```

4. Use `objdump -d` and `readelf -a` to inspect binary layout and symbols.

## Repository Structure

- `labs/` — (expected) directory with per-lab source, Makefiles, and README for each lab.
- `docs/` — (optional) extra explanations, cheat-sheets, and diagrams.
- `scripts/` — helper scripts for building, running, or visualizing memory/state.

If any of these directories are missing, check the individual lab folders or ask for guidance.

## Safety and Responsible Use

These labs are intended for educational use only. Do not use the techniques learned here for unauthorized access, exploitation, or malicious activity. Always practice in isolated, legal, and ethical environments.

## Contributing

Contributions, corrections, and improvements are welcome. If you'd like to add a new lab or improve documentation, open a PR with a clear description and any required build/test steps.

## Next Steps

- I can list the current lab files in the repository, add a `labs/` placeholder structure, or tailor this README to mention specific files present in this repo—tell me which you prefer.
